# Webhooks

In this guide, we will look at how to register and consume webhooks to integrate your app with Lightfunnels. With webhooks, your app can know when something happens in Lightfunnels, such as when a new order is created. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Registering webhooks

To register a new webhook, you need to have a URL in your app that Lightfunnels can call. You can configure a new webhook using the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql {{ title: 'GraphQL Query' }}
# Query
mutation CreateWebhookMutation($node: WebhookInput!) {
 createWebhook(node: $node) {
	type
	settings
	url
 }
}
```
```
input WebhookInput {
  type: String!
  url: String!
  settings: WebhookSettings!
}

scalar WebhookSettings
```
```json {{ title: 'GraphQL Variables'}}
{
    "node": {
        "type": "order/confirmed",
        "url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/order-created/{{account-id}}",
        "settings": {}
    }
}
```


The `type` property refers to the event that you would like to listen to. Refer to [event types](#event-types) for a list of available events.

<Note>
Note that in the above, we pass the `account ID` to the URL so your app knows to which account the webhook call corresponds to. This refers to the ID of the account in your own database.
</Note>

In this example, we used the `order/confirmed` event. Now, whenever a new order is made, a webhook is fired off and your app receives all the information related to the new order. In the next section, we'll look at how to consume webhooks.

## Consuming webhooks

When your app receives a webhook request from Lightfunnels, you should verify the authenticity of the request by validating the `lightfunnels-hmac` property from the header using your `client secret`.

Here is an exampe code on how to authenticate the request using Note.js.

```js
import crypto from "crypto";

// This is an example of a webhook handler implemented in Node.js
const webhookHandler = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        if (!await verifyWebhook(req)) {
            return res.status(403).send("Invalid webhook");
        }

		// Webhook is valid, continue with your logic here

	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error);
		return res.status(500).send("Internal server error");
	}
}

// This function verifies the webhook using the lightfunnels-hmac header
const verifyWebhook = async (req) => {

    // calculate the hmac
    const localyCalculatedHmac = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", process.env.LF_APP_SECRET)
    .update(JSON.stringify(req.body), "utf8")
    .digest("base64");

    // check if the hmac is the same as the one in the lightfunnels-hmac header
    const hmac = req.headers["lightfunnels-hmac"];
    if(localyCalculatedHmac != hmac){
        // this webhook is fishy, abort!
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```
