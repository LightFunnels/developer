# Webhooks

In this guide, we will look at how to register and consume webhooks to integrate your app with Lightfunnels. With webhooks, your app can know when something happens in Lightfunnels, such as when a new order is created. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Registering webhooks

To register a new webhook, you need to have a URL in your app that Lightfunnels can call. You can configure a new webhook using the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql {{ title: 'GraphQL Query' }}
# Query
mutation CreateWebhookMutation($node: WebhookInput!) {
 createWebhook(node: $node) {
	type
	settings
	url
 }
}
```
```
input WebhookInput {
  type: String!
  url: String!
  settings: WebhookSettings!
}

scalar WebhookSettings
```
```json {{ title: 'GraphQL Variables'}}
{
    "node": {
        "type": "order/created",
        "url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/order-created/{{account-id}}",
        "settings": {}
    }
}
```


The `type` property refers to the event that you would like to listen to. Refer to [event types](#event-types) for a list of available events.

<Note>
Note that in the above, we pass the `account ID` to the URL so your app knows to which account the webhook call corresponds to. This refers to the ID of the account in your own database.
</Note>

In this example, we used the `order/created` event. Now, whenever a new order is created, a webhook is fired off and your app receives all the information related to the new order. In the next section, we'll look at how to consume webhooks.

## Consuming webhooks

When your app receives a webhook request from Lightfunnels, you should verify the authenticity of the request by validating the `lightfunnels-hmac` from the header using your `client secret`.

Here is an exampe code on how to authenticate the request using Note.js.

```js
import crypto from "crypto";

// calculate the hmac
const localyCalculatedHmac = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", CLIENT_SECRET)
    .update(event.body!, "utf8")
    .digest("base64");

// check if the hmac is the same as the one in the lightfunnels-hmac header
const hmac = event.headers["lightfunnels-hmac"];
if(localyCalculatedHmac != hmac){
  // this webhook is fishy, abort!
}
```

## Security

To know for sure that a webhook was, in fact, sent by Lightfunnels instead of a malicious actor, you can verify the request signature. Each webhook request contains a header named `x-Lightfunnels-signature`, and you can verify this signature by using your secret webhook key. The signature is an HMAC hash of the request payload hashed using your secret key. Here is an example of how to verify the signature in your app:

<CodeGroup title="Verifying a request">

```js
const signature = req.headers['x-Lightfunnels-signature']
const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')

if (hash === signature) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

```python
from flask import request
import hashlib
import hmac

signature = request.headers.get("x-Lightfunnels-signature")
hash = hmac.new(bytes(secret, "ascii"), bytes(payload, "ascii"), hashlib.sha256)

if hash.hexdigest() == signature:
    # Request is verified
else:
    # Request could not be verified
```

```php
$signature = $request['headers']['x-Lightfunnels-signature'];
$hash = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $secret);

if (hash_equals($hash, $signature)) {
  // Request is verified
} else {
  // Request could not be verified
}
```

</CodeGroup>

If your generated signature matches the `x-Lightfunnels-signature` header, you can be sure that the request was truly coming from Lightfunnels. It's essential to keep your secret webhook key safe — otherwise, you can no longer be sure that a given webhook was sent by Lightfunnels. Don't commit your secret webhook key to GitHub!
