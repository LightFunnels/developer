# Guide to Charging for Your Apps

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of handling app charges in Lightfunnels.

## Overview

Charging for your apps in Lightfunnels is a straightforward process. Here are the key points to keep in mind:

- **One Active Charge Per Account:**
  - At any given time, an app can have only one active charge per user account.

- **Automatic Deactivation:**
  - Activating a new charge will automatically deactivate any previous charges associated with the user's account.

- **Free Trial Recommendation:**
  - For a positive user experience, it is highly recommended to include a free trial period with your charge.
