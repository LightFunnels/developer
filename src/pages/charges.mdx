## Create a New App Charge

In this guide, we'll cover the steps to create a charge for your app using GraphQL.

## Step 1: Create a Charge

To create a new charge for your app, you'll need to use the "createAppChargeMutation" GraphQL mutation. 

 **Explore Mutation Details:**
   - Visit [Create App Charges](/app-charges#create-app-charges) to learn about the "createAppChargeMutation" GraphQL mutation.

## Step 2: Obtain Charge URL

Once you've created the charge, the response will contain a URL. Extract this URL from the response payload.

## Step 3: Redirect User to Accept Charge

Send the user to the obtained charge URL. This can typically be done by redirecting the user's browser to the URL.

## Step 4: Redirect User Upon Charge Acceptance or Denial

Upon the user's acceptance or denial of the charge, they will automatically be redirected to the specified return_url that was provided in the charge creation process.

## Step 5: Check Charge Status

You can query the charge status using the following GraphQL query:

   - Visit [App charge query](/app-charges#get-an-app-charge) to understand the "appCharge" GraphQL query.
