## Welcome! {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, you need to create a Lightfunnels application. For the time being, this process is done by [contacting our team](mailto:support@lightfunnels.com?subject=New%20Lightfunnels%20application%20request&body=Hello%20Lightfunnels%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20create%20a%20new%20application%20to%20use%20your%20API.%0D%0A%0D%0AMy%20app%20name%20is%3A%20REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME%0D%0AMy%20app%20URL%20is%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2F%0D%0AMy%20redirect%20URL%20is%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fredirect%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks%0D%0A%0D%0AYour%20name). Once your application is created, we will provide you with your application keys that you can use to generate your access tokens and interact with the API.  {{ className: 'lead' }}
