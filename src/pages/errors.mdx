# Errors

This document outlines the standard approach for handling errors in our API responses. Our error responses are structured in a JSON format, providing clear and actionable information to the client. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Error Response Format
Errors are returned in a consistent structure, making it easier for clients to parse and take appropriate actions. Here's the structure of our standard error response:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "You don't have access to this store",
            "name": "ReportedError",
            "key": "errors_store_access",
            "path": []
        }
    ]
}
```
### Fields Description

- `errors`: An array of error objects.
    - `message`: A human-readable message providing more details about the error.
    - `name`: The name of the error, typically a broad classification like `ReportedError`.
    - `key`: A unique identifier for the error, useful for client-side parsing.
    - `path`: An array that indicates the location of the error, typically used for form validation errors.

## Handling Errors

1. **Parse Error Response**: Always check for the `errors` field in the response.
2. **Identify Error Type**: Use the `key` or `name` to identify the type of error.
3. **User Communication**: Display the `message` to the user if it's intended for them.
4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Log the error details for monitoring and debugging purposes.
5. **Conditional Logic**: Implement conditional logic based on `key` to handle specific errors uniquely.
