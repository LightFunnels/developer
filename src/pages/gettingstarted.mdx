# Getting Started

Welcome to the Lightfunnels GraphQL API documentation! This page will provide you with an overview of how to get started with using the Lightfunnels GraphQL API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Prerequisites

Before you start using the Lightfunnels GraphQL API, you will need the following:

- An active Lightfunnels account. You can [sign up here](https://app.lightfunnels.com/admin/auth/signup).
- An `client ID` and `app secret`, which can be obtained by [contacting our team](mailto:support@lightfunnels.com?subject=New%20Lightfunnels%20application%20request&body=Hello%20Lightfunnels%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20would%20like%20to%20create%20a%20new%20application%20to%20use%20your%20API.%0D%0A%0D%0AMy%20app%20name%20is%3A%20REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME%0D%0AMy%20app%20URL%20is%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2F%0D%0AMy%20redirect%20URL%20is%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fredirect%0D%0A%0D%0AThanks%0D%0A%0D%0AYour%20name)
- Familiarity with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), including the GraphQL syntax and GraphQL HTTP requests

## Making a Query
To make a GraphQL query using the Lightfunnels API, you will need to send an HTTP POST request to the API endpoint with the following parameters:

- `query`: The GraphQL query, encoded as a string
- `variables` (optional): A JSON object containing variables for the query

### Authorization
You should also include your API `access token` in the Authorization header of the request as follows:
```json {{ title: 'Authorization header' }}
Authorization: Bearer <your access token>
```
Learn how to get your access token on the [Access Token page](/authentication) {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Apps

To have access to an app you have to have an `App ID`, which can be obtained by [contacting our team](mailto:support@lightfunnels.com),
then you can access your app through https://app.lightfunnels.com/admin/apps/`{{app_id}}`

### Endpoint

The GraphQL API endpoint for all your queries is:

```text {{ title: 'GraphQL endpoint' }}
https://services.lightfunnels.com/api/v2
```

## Query Example
Here is an example of a GraphQL query to get the title of a product with the id of `1`:


```graphql {{ title: 'Example query' }}
query getProduct{
    product(id: 1){
        title
    }
}
```

Example response:

```json {{ title: 'Example query' }}
{
    "data": {
        "product": {
            "title": "Awesome Product Example"
        }
    }
}
```
