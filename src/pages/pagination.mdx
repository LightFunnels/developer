# Pagination
This document explains the approach to implement pagination in GraphQL queries, specifically for listing resources such as `funnels`. The pagination is based on cursor-based pagination principles.

## Pagination Query Structure
A GraphQL query for pagination includes parameters for controlling the number of items (`first`), and the point to start fetching items (`after`). Below is a template for a pagination query:

```graphql
{
  "query": "query funnelsQuery(
    $first: Int
    $after: String
    $query: String!
  ) {
    ...funnelsPagination
  }

  fragment funnelsPagination on Query {
    pagination: funnels(first: $first, after: $after, query: $query) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          slug
          published
          created_at
          updated_at
          share_code
          destinationTemplate {
            uid: id
            id
          }
          currency
          __typename
        }
        cursor
      }
      pageInfo {
        endCursor
        hasNextPage
      }
    }
  }
",
  "variables": {
    "query": "order_by:id order_dir:desc",
    "first": 25
  }
}
```
### Query Parameters

- `first`: The number of records to fetch.
- `after`: A cursor, indicating the starting point for fetching records.
- `query`: A query string to filter or sort the data.

### Response Structure

- `edges`: An array of edge objects, each representing an item.
    - `node`: The actual item with its fields.
    - `cursor`: A unique identifier for the item, used for pagination.
- `pageInfo`: Contains pagination information.
    - `endCursor`: The cursor of the last item in the response.
    - `hasNextPage`: A boolean indicating if there are more items to fetch.

## Implementing Pagination

### Fetching Initial Data

- Set the `first` parameter to define how many items you want to load initially.
- Leave the `after` parameter empty to start from the beginning.

### Fetching More Data

- Use the `endCursor` from the `pageInfo` as the `after` value in the next query.
- Check `hasNextPage` before making the next query to ensure there are more items to fetch.

## Example Usage

### Query for First Page

```graphql
{
  "query": "...",
  "variables": {
    "query": "order_by:id order_dir:desc",
    "first": 25
  }
}
```
### Query for Subsequent Pages

To fetch subsequent pages, you will need to use the `endCursor` from the previous query's response. Here's how the query should be structured:

```graphql
{
  "query": "...",
  "variables": {
    "query": "order_by:id order_dir:desc",
    "first": 25,
    "after": "[endCursor from previous response]"
  }
}
```
In this query:

- The `first` parameter remains the same, indicating the number of items you want to fetch.
- The `after` parameter is set to the `endCursor` from the previous page's `pageInfo`. This tells the server to start fetching results from the next item after the given cursor.

### Continuation Logic

When implementing pagination:

1. **Check `hasNextPage`**: Before performing a subsequent query, always check the `hasNextPage` boolean from the `pageInfo` of the current response. If `hasNextPage` is false, there are no more items to fetch.
2. **Update `after` Parameter**: If `hasNextPage` is true, use the `endCursor` as the `after` parameter in your next query.
3. **Repeat Process**: Continue this process to navigate through the pages of data.

## Best Practices

- **Caching**: Consider caching the `endCursor` of each page for a smoother backward navigation experience.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for scenarios where the `endCursor` might be invalid or expired.
- **Performance Considerations**: Monitor the performance impact of large `first` values, as fetching too many items at once can impact server performance.

## Conclusion

Cursor-based pagination in GraphQL is an effective way to handle large datasets. By following the outlined approach and best practices, developers can implement a robust and efficient pagination system in their GraphQL APIs.
